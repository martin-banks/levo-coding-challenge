# Levo Coding challenge

**Challenge instructions on the inclluded PDF**


## Assumptions + descision

- Content for the header is not included
- Each card displays the date (DD/MM/YYYY), title and summary of each article
- Additionally, include the name of the news site source; help readers find sources they prefer (and avoid those they don't)
- The Read more buttons open a new window linking out to the full article
- 'Load More' button will load an additional 6 articles
- Grid should reflow gracefully to suit different screen sizes
- This is a public api with no private key; therefore, we can fetch data from the client
- Each article has an image reference as part of its response; let's use it! Images can provide more information at a glance about the content and assist in creating a visual cadence for improved browsing
- Adding a background picture for the header to create a little more visual interest



## Tech
